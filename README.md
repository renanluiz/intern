# Overview

The Intern bot is a discord fellow always up to help you by playing songs from youtube/soundcloud, searching for lyrics, and some basic server administration functionallities.
The bot is always present in our happy hours and has very interesting commands. This project was built using Nodejs, DiscordJS and was based on Evobot's project, 
which you can check out by <a href="https://github.com/eritislami/evobot">clicking here</a>.

This is a *self-hosted bot* â€“ meaning you will need to host and maintain your own instance in order to use it.
